# The Log

*Daily proof of work. Proof of struggle. Proof of learning.*

---

## How to Use This

Update daily. Be honest. Document failures more carefully than successes — that's where the learning lives.

This log serves three purposes:
1. **Consolidation** — Writing forces understanding
2. **Reference** — Future you will forget what past you learned
3. **Evidence** — Interview material that can't be faked
